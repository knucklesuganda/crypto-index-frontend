We use it to track the price of the index and complete all operations. Once you have it, write the amount and buy your tokens. Then, you will need to wait for an indefinite period of settlement. During that period, we will buy all tokens and distribute the debt. Once there is enough debt, you can retrieve it in a separate operation and get your tokens!"

But, instead, we add debt to the system that indicates that you need to receive some money in the future. If there are enough fees collected, the settlement process will begin. Then, you can get the amount of tokens that we could buy(it can be higher or lower that the amount you requested). But, be careful with the settlement process. IT WILL NOT START UNTIL THERE ARE ENOUGH FEES, AND ALL THE OPERATIONS ARE IRREVERSIBLE. THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN WAIT FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD TO RECEIVE YOUR TOKENS"
